Reproducible Data Course Project 1
===================================================================================
This repository is for the Coursera "Reproducible Data" course project #1.

The goal is to simply examine the personal activity recorded in a monitoring device
collected during the months of October and November, 2012 from an anonymous individual.

The data for this project can be downloaded through the following link:

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA)

date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format

interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

=========================================================================================

You should create a Rmarkdown file that accomplishes the following and answers the following questions:

1- Loading and preprocessing the data.

2- What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

3- Wha is the average daily activity pattern?

4- Imputing missing values.

5- Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

=============================================================================================

Files
PA1_template.Rmd, PA1_template.md, PA1_template.html contains the R scripts that performs the analysis on the raw data.
hist_total_steps.png, hist_total_steps2.png, time_interval_steps.png and time_panel.png are the end results from running the conde on the four R scripts.
